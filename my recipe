lemonade 
Slice the lemons in half.
Squeeze them into a large measuring cup. A citrus juicer or squeezer makes this process easier. There should be about 1 1/2 cups of lemon juice to make 2 quarts of lemonade.
Remove any seeds.
Combine the lemon juice and sugar, stir into the cold water. Serve over ice.
